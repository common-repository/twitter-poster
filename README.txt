== Description ==

The Twitter Poster is a plugin which allows wordpress publishers to automatically post their new posts to their Twitter account. The Twitter
Poster will take the title of a new post and will subit it to the Twitter account specified in the options. It will also add the link back to
the post, allowing your twitter followers to access the post details

Currently, the Twitter Poster consists of the following features.

1. Specify your Twitter username and password, the number of followers you would like to add and the broad term used to
identify potential users you could follow.
2. Displays a summary of your twitter account on the Twitter Poster options page e.g. Number of followers, number of posts
3. Automatically sends new posts to the specified Twitter account.
4. Automatically add friends related to the tags specified by th euser
5. Pings the Twitter feed to the ping list setup in your wordpress installation
6. If you are following 2000 people but have less than 2000 followers, Twitter will stop you following new people. This plugin will remove old members and add new members until you reach the correct number of followers to allow you to follow more members

** An optional sponsor link will be included in every 5th post/tweet. This sponsored tweet/link can be disabled on the settings page by un-checking the "Allow Sponsor Tweet" checkbox
